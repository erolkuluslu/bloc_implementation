- **To-Do List Management**: Add tasks to a to-do list using Cubit.
- **State Management with Bloc and Cubit**: Examples of both state management approaches.
- **Clean and Modular Code**: Well-structured codebase for easy understanding and extension.

## Project Structure

- **bloc**: Contains the CounterBloc for managing the counter state.
- **cubit**: Contains the TodoCubit for managing the list of to-dos.
- **models**: Defines the Todo model.
- **screens**: Contains the main UI components and pages.
